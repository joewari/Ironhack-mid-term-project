### Project Elevator Pitch:

       Circle Agency webpage is a web base designing platform
        ** How does it work? **
        The project is a simple 3 pages navigation web site. Designed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
        HTML: For this project, i designed 3 HTML files so as to make the navigation process work seamlessly and all of these files are interconnected.

        CSS: Here i used a single CSS file for all the HTML document, i employed the services of Grid layout, Flex boxing, Position Styling as well as CSS animation Properties.

        JavaScript: Through the use of JavaScript, I was able to feed my webpages with relevant information fetched from API endpoints using Async Await and Try Catch methods. Also i was able to validate the contact form data entry. I separated all the Js codes i used separate files and linked them to the html file were needed so the page can load faster.

        Also webpages has a page loader, just to give an effect and good user experience, like it is said “Your website is the center of your digital eco-system…”.

        ** Why did you choose it? **
         I got involved in this project, because it was a requirement as partial fulfilment required for my training as a web developer. Moreso, I took the project head on because it looked interesting at first glance, and i loved that it pushed me  to think outside the box. Overall, it was a thrilling and satisfying experience
